## My process

This was a really frustrating challenge because things kept breaking left and right. Positioning wouldn't work, margin's wouldn't work, it was really annoying.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I could have likely done this in a simpler way, but ah well, as long as the final result turns out fine.

### Continued development

I'm going to study more about the things that went wrong with this project.
